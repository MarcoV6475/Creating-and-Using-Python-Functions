# Creating-and-Using-Python-Functions
This is Module 7 Assingment for CSS-225: This week we had 6 problems to solve.
Problem 1 -- First step was finding the area of a circle by using the function "areOfCircle(r)" as well as utilize the math module.
Problem 2 -- In this problem I tested if the number 8 is in the range of (1,10) and in this case it is so it will print the statement, "8 is in the range."
Problem 3 -- Had a list from [5,2,7,-1] and the function "total * =x" helped me mulitply all numbers to equal -70.
Problem 4 -- This code used the function "append" which would go through the list of: [1,3,3,3,6,2,3,5] and will append the number 3 and make sure than number is not repeated in the new unique list: [1,3,6,2,5].
Problem 5 -- I looked over the book online and was able to come up with codes found in other resources online, to make the multiple squares; it utilized penup and pendown for each new square.
Problem 6 -- I used a similar method from problem 5 but this time everytime the range is changed I made sure to divide 360 by the range. (Ex: range=10 -> 360/10=36) Knowing the number I made the hexagon turn left by 60 or 36 (depending on the range) and move forward by 100, to create the pink flower.
